# Game Design Library

GDL is a human-curated list of articles on various game design topics. Find game-design tips/advice on specific genres/aspects. You can use the search, or browse tag-specific pages to find the articles you want. Built in [Tropical](github.com/nightblade9/tropical).

# Submitting an Article

Take a look at the `data.json` file and open a pull-request with your changes for additional articles.

- For tag ideas, look at existing tags, and think about what people might search for
- For the blurb, try to include words that people searching for your article would use to find it

If you're stuck, feel free to open a PR for an entry with just a title and URL, and I'll see if I can provide my thoughts on the tags and blurb.
