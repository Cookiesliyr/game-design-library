<h2>What is the Game Design Library?</h1>

<p class="lead">The Game Design Library is a curated catalogue of game-design links. We created this site with one goal: to make it easy for game-designers and non-designers alike find relevant, useful information about game design, and their specific game-design problems.</p>

<p>We scoured the internet to find relevant pages on the theory and practice of game design; everything from general high-level concepts such as player types, to genre- and problem-specific pages (e.g. how can I design interesting boss battles for my JRPG?</p>

<p>Note that GDL is about <em>game design</em>, not game development. We don't list any links about programming, game art, character rigging, marketing tips, monetization, or any other facets of game development; we focus strictly on game design.</p>

<p>The GDL is an ongoing project - we add links on an ongoing basis. Contributions are always welcome! If you are interested, please take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/nightblade9/game-design-library/blob/main/data.json">data.json</a> file, click edit (pencil icon), make your changes, and then <a href="https://github.com/nightblade9/game-design-library/pulls">open a PR</a> so we can review/integrate them.</p>
