    <h1>What is the Game Design Library?</h1>

    <p>The Game Design Library is a curated catalogue of game-design links. We created this site with one goal: can we make it easy for game-designers and non-designers alike find relevant, useful information about game design, and their specific game-design problems?</p>

    <p>We scoured the internet to find relevant pages on the theory and practice of game design; everything from general high-level concepts such as player types, to genre- and problem-specific pages (how can I design interesting boss battles for my JRPG?</p>

    <p>The GDL is an ongoing project - we add links on an ongoing basis. Contributions are always welcome! If you are interested, please take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/nightblade9/game-design-library/blob/main/data.json">data.json</a> file, and then <a href="https://github.com/nightblade9/game-design-library/pulls">open a PR</a> with your suggested changes. (You can also click "edit" in GitHub and change the file directly for easy/simple changes.)</p>
