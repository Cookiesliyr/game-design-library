<h2>What is the Game Design Library?</h1>

<p class="lead">I created Game Design Library to make it easy to find links about game design, both broadly (how do I design engaging mechanics in a puzzle game?) and specific (how do I balance combat in my JRPG)?</p>

<p>Who am I? Just your run-of-the-mill <a href="https://twitter.com/nightblade99">solo game developer</a>. As a developer with no formal game-design training or prior game-design experience, I found it difficult to find game design topics online. Many articles, videos, and tweets claim to be about game design, but really just talk about game development - how to code procedural dungeon generation or animate a mesh with bones.</p>

<p>Instead, I wanted to find material about <em>game design</em> - topics as varied as:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Balancing difficulty in a JRPG</li>
    <li>How to perfect your core game loop</li>
    <li>Modulating difficulty over time so players don't feel underwhelmed or overwhelmed</li>
    <li>Adding a unique twist to game NPCs to make them memorable</li>
    <li>What kind of behaviour does loot-boxes encourage?</li>
</ul>

<p>Since this material is readily available - albeit difficult to find in search-engines - I started collecting together articles and videos, describing and tagging them appropriately so they're easy to find. The results are Game Design Library (GDL).</p>

<p>As GDL is an ongoing project - I add links on an ongoing basis - contributions are always welcome! If you are interested, please take a look at the source <a href="https://github.com/nightblade9/game-design-library/blob/main/data.json">data.json</a> file, click edit (pencil icon), make your changes, and then <a href="https://github.com/nightblade9/game-design-library/pulls">open a PR</a> so I can review/integrate them.</p>
